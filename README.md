# Real Time Object Detection
This is an implementation of  object detection API using Tensorflow models for running it in Real time through Webcam. I have used COCO dataset for the implementation.
The official tensorflow object detection API link is https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/object_detection

For running the object detection on image files run the detection_main.py
All the models need to be downloaded first in order to run the main file.
